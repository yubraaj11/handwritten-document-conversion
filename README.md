# **Handwritten Document Conversion**

## **Introduction**

This project focuses on building an end-to-end system to detect and convert handwritten text, specifically in Devanagari script. Leveraging advanced models like TrOCR (Transformer-based OCR), the system extracts text from scanned documents, including both printed and handwritten content, with a focus on Nepali language. The model uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) as an encoder to process image features and NepBERT, a variant of RoBERTa, as a decoder to generate text.

## **Goals**

- Develop a high-accuracy OCR model for handwritten Nepali text recognition.
- Automate the conversion of scanned handwritten documents into digital text.

# **Status**

- Current phase: **Model Deployment**

## **Known Issues**

- Minor inaccuracies in detecting certain handwritten styles.
- Overfitting on specific types of Devanagari words. IT still lacks robustness to generailze in Nepali Handwritten Texts.

## **High-Level Next Steps**

- Fine-tune the model to handle additional handwritten styles.
- Expand the system to support batch inference of documents.

# **Usage**

## **Creating Virtual Environment**

This project requires `python-3.10`. To ensure compatibility, we recommend creating a virtual environment.

```bash
conda create -n handwritten python==3.10
conda activate handwritten
```

## **Pulling Repository**

### For Linux

```commandline
git clone git@github.com:fuseai-fellowship/hand-written-document-conversion.git
```

### For Windows

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/fuseai-fellowship/hand-written-document-conversion.git
```

## **Install required requirements**

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To sync and clean unused dependencies:

```bash
make deps-sync
```

## **Usage Instructions**

Follow the below instructions to run the system and test it on your documents:

1. Upload a scanned handwritten document.
2. Run the system to extract the handwritten text.
3. View the results in digital format displayed beside the image input.

# **Data Source**

- The system uses a custom dataset with handwritten Nepali text, both printed and annotated.
- Source data includes documents from various sectors such as education and government.

## **Code Structure**

- **/src**: Contains the core processing scripts.
- **/notebook**: Contains the notebook used while finetuning TrOCR model.
- **/models**: Includes the pre-trained YOLO model for text-detection.
- **/data**: Houses training and test datasets.

## **Artifacts Location**

- Output files and extracted texts are stored in the `/output` directory.


---

# **Results**

## **Metrics Used**

- **Character Error Rate (CER)**: Measures accuracy in recognizing handwritten characters.


## **Evaluation Results**

- The system achieved a **CER of 9.05%** on the test set.
- These results demonstrate the modelâ€™s ability to generalize across different handwriting styles.
